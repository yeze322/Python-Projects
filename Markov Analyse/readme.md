# Use Markov Chain To Analyze And Predict Sentece#

mainly consisted by:
	
	1 - word_tokenizer use nltk.word_tokenized() function, to count the frequence of one word's appearence

	2 - Marcov Chain Lib Creater

	I use A+B as the key (two words) , And those words are saved using Hash table ( split by ASCII ).

	I want to make it better use MySQL.

	In this version, add different file will be quite hard.
